Setting up Hyperledger Fabric on a Mac for Node.js involves several steps, including installing the necessary dependencies, setting up the development environment, and configuring Hyperledger Fabric. Here is a step-by-step guide:

### Prerequisites

1. **Homebrew**: Ensure you have Homebrew installed. You can install it using:

   ```sh
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```

2. **Docker Desktop**: Install Docker Desktop for Mac. You can download it from [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

3. **Node.js**: Install Node.js, jq and npm. You can use Homebrew:

   ```sh
   brew install node
   brew install jq
   ```

4. **Go**: Hyperledger Fabric requires Go for certain components. Install Go using Homebrew:
   ```sh
   brew install go
   ```

### Step 1: Install Fabric Samples, Binaries, and Docker Images

**Download the Fabric binaries and Docker images**:

```sh
curl -sSL https://bit.ly/2ysbOFE | bash -s
```

### Step 2: Set Up Your Environment

1. **Add Fabric binaries to your PATH**. Add the following lines to your `.bash_profile`, `.zshrc`, or equivalent:

   ```sh
   echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/bin' >> ~/.zshrc
   ```

2. **Source the profile to apply changes**:
   ```sh
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

### Step 3: Launch the Test Network

1. **Navigate to the test network directory**:

   ```sh
   cd test-network
   ```

2. **Start the test network**:

   ```sh
   ./network.sh up
   ```

3. **Create a channel**:
   ```sh
   ./network.sh createChannel
   ```

### Step 4: Install and Instantiate Chaincode

1. **Deploy the chaincode using Node.js**:
   ```sh
   ./network.sh deployCC -ccn basic -ccp ../chaincode-javascript/ -ccl javascript
   ```

### Step 5: Set Up the Node.js Application

1. **Navigate to the application directory**:

   ```sh
   cd backend/src
   ```

2. **Install the required Node.js packages**:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the application**:
   ```sh
   node app.js
   ```

### Step 6: Verify the Setup

1. **Check the Docker containers** to ensure that the Hyperledger Fabric components are running:

   ```sh
   docker ps
   ```

2. **Interact with the application** to verify that it is communicating with the Hyperledger Fabric network as expected.
